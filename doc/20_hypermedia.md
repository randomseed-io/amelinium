# Hypermedia-driven

Amelinium is made with **[hypermedia][HATEOAS]** in mind. Therefore, it supports
[RESTful][REST], [document-oriented][HS] architecture, in which a dynamic HTML
content is generated by the HTTP server and rendered by a browser. Thanks to
**[HTMX][HTMX]** JavaScript library user interaction is possible without reloading
the whole document and without visiting multiple web page.

HTMX integration is not enforced. It is possible to use multi-page approach based on
redirects and regular links. Amelinium dynamically detects if it can make use of
HTMX.

## Model, layout, view, controller

Client-server architecture and resources organization is similar to [JSP model
2][Model-2] architecture. Requests from the browser are passed to the **controller**,
a function assigned to a certain HTTP route in server's configuration. The controller
performs any logic necessary to obtain the correct content for display and sets
template variables used when rendering a document with HTML templates (a **layout**
and a **view** files associated with a route or picked up dynamically by the
controller). The result of rendering (HTML document) is then returned to the browser
to be displayed. Controllers can use **models** (also functions) to access persistent
data.
